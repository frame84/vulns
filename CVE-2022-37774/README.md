# Technical details

## Broken Access Control - Maarch RM All versions, {url}/tmp/{MD5 hash of the document}

- Details : When accessing a document (pdf, email, etc.) from an archive, a preview is proposed by the application, depending on the configuration of the preview function. This preview generates a URL including an md5 hash of the file accessed. This URL is then accessible without authentication.
- Privileges: No privilege required, the attacker just needs to know the URL (browser history, logs access).
- Location example: http[s]://{url}/tmp/{MD5 hash of the document}

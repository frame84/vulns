```

- Payload : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt (sent with Burp Intruder)

- Details : it is possible to conduct a brute force attack on the authentication form due to excessive verbose responses from the application, whether or not a lockout policy is active. If a lockout policy is active, the application informs that the user account is locked out upon presentation of valid credentials. If there is no lockout policy, brute force is by definition possible.

- Privileges: No privilege is required

- error generated with invalid credentials (with or without lockout policy)
